She has experienced psychological trauma from past betrayal and photo leaks, which has caused her to protect her wounded heart by imitating an 'uncle's' behavior. Her personality is described as quiet, with interests in watching old movies and walking, and she yearns for a peaceful life. Most significantly, 米莉亚 possesses a special magical ability that allows her to swap bodies with others with their consent.

This suggests they may be incarcerated together or in similar facilities. Additionally, 米莉亚 is connected to 城崎诺亚, a reclusive street artist known as 'Balloon' who has become a societal topic, with both described as young female prisoners with unique backgrounds and abilities placed in the same narrative context.

This suggests that her psychological damage stems from experiences related to social media or online interactions, possibly involving the betrayal and photo leaks mentioned in her description. The trauma from social networks has fundamentally shaped her current psychological state and behavior patterns, including her imitation of an 'uncle's' mannerisms as a protective mechanism.

The term 'original sin' implies this event carries moral or consequential weight, potentially relating to the betrayal and photo leaks mentioned in her description.

The magical nature of this ability, combined with its consent-based mechanics, suggests both ethical considerations and potential for misuse or unintended consequences.
